This network is used to find 10 similar images(present in the database) based on the given image.
It uses RNN to extract the features of all the images present in the database and the given input image, and stores them in a pickle file in order to avoid re-running the network.
It then uses KNN to compare the features of the input image and the database images, and finds the 10 nearest neighbors of the input image.
It then prints the 10 nearest neighbor images along with its KNN distance to the input image.
In this case, a database of images of monkey species is used.
